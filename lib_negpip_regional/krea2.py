"""NegPiP Regional support for Forge Neo's Krea 2 diffusion model.

Krea 2 encodes the prompt with Qwen3-VL, then concatenates the resulting text
tokens with the reference and image streams inside a single transformer.

Where CLIP and T5 weight the *output* of the text encoder, this engine weights
the *input* embeddings instead, so a negative weight never scales the
representation of a word: it hands the language model a negated embedding,
which stands for no word at all.  Sign flipping that output cannot recover the
concept, which is why negative weights read as doing nothing here however they
were masked afterwards.  The word is therefore encoded at its magnitude, so
the conditioning stays a faithful representation of it, and the sign is
carried separately as a mask that negates the value projection of those tokens
in every single-stream block.  Attention still routes to the concept, and the
image stream subtracts it instead of adding it, which is what NegPiP is.  The
SD implementation has the same shape: it encodes the negated concept with a
positive weight for exactly this reason.

The text engine turns emphasis off entirely as soon as a reference image is
attached, since the vision tower expands one token into many embeddings and the
weights no longer line up.  The engine hooks below keep the emphasis alive for
that path and expand the weights over the inserted embeddings instead.

The engine also wraps every emphasis region in its own copy of the chat
template, which is invisible at weight 1.0 but hands a weighted region some
thirty tokens of system prompt and chat scaffolding.  Negating those instead of
the words of the prompt is what made a negative weight read as a no-op, so the
template is emitted only once here.
